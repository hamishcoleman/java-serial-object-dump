This tool was written to help debugging the data between two java
applications.  A packet sniffer was inserted inline and TCP connection
traces were taken of the traffic.  This was used to determine that the
data was a Java "Remote Method Invocation" (RMI) call, transported over
a HTTP POST.

To use, invoke with the filename containing the TCP stream data.  All the
class definitions and objects contained in the stream will be read and
printed out, both as a pseudo java code and as a perl data::dumper (for
debugging)
